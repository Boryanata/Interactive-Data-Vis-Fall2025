<span style="font-size: 24px;">Tracking and Understanding My dietary patterns</span>

**Dataset and Variables**

I started collecting diet data on 3/22/2025 and continued recording until 4/2/2025. During that period, I managed to log every single meal and ended up collecting 41 observations in total. I created a spreadsheet and, for the sake of accuracy, logged my meals as soon as possible after I was finished eating. I also had a backup notepad, where I was recording meals while on the go, and copied the observations to the spreadsheet on the next day. That was extremely helpful, as I noticed that I would forget meal times and details after a day of not logging. 

<br><br>

I‚Äôve tracked the following variables, which represent the columns in my dataset:

1. Timestamp
2. Type of Meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
3. Healthy Index (on a scale of 1-5)
4. Main Meal Ingredient (e.g. rice, potatoes, quinoa, etc.)
5. Home-cooked (dummy variable ‚Äì Yes/No)
6. Alcohol Consumption (dummy variable ‚Äì Yes/No)
7. Location (home, office, dine out)
8. On Time (dummy variable ‚Äì Yes/No)
9. Mood Before (on a scale of 1-5)
10. Mood After (on a scale of 1-5)
11. Mood Change (calculated variable I created = [Mood after] ‚Äì [Mood before])
